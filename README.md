At the crossroads of technology, warm hospitality, and literary imagination, I invite you to discover my world.

I'm Grégory Pagnoux, a creative person with a passion for innovation and exploring new horizons. I'm currently a student at ALGOSUP, a software development school 💻, where I'm honing my technical skills and developing innovative solutions for tomorrow's challenges.

Alongside my studies, I work as a receptionist at the espace Maurice Rollinat in Vierzon. This dynamic environment not only allows me to meet a diversity of people and cultures but also to develop my communication and reception management skills. My role is to ensure a warm and efficient welcome, contributing to a pleasant experience for all visitors.

But that's not all! I've also just taken an exciting new step in my life: publishing my first book 📖, "Une Vie, Deux Histoires". This literary project, fuelled by years of inspiration and hard work, represents a real personal achievement. My book is a plunge into an imaginative world where words and ideas come to life, offering readers a fascinating and rewarding escape.

I'm constantly looking for new opportunities to learn 🎓, create💡and share 🤗. Whether through my studies, my work, or my personal projects, I strive to leave a positive mark and contribute to a more creative and inspired world 🌍.

Feel free to contact me to exchange ideas, collaborate on projects, or simply discuss our shared passions.
